<h3>Hotels</h3>
<p>Mike and Yalu will be reserving a block of hotel rooms at a discounted rate, in the near future, for our guests' convenience.  More information will follow on this section of the page once we have finalized the details.  Guests do not have to stay in the same hotel, or stay at hotels at all.  Since May is college graduation season in Boston, hotel rooms may be hard to find or pricey.  For those who do not want to go the hotel route, we suggest the followigng options:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Staying with friends in the area
  <li> Renting through airbnb.com
