<p>
Mike and Yalu met during their freshmen year at MIT.  They both were involved in the same student organization, the <a href="http://esp.mit.edu/">MIT Education Studies Program</a> (ESP).  Yalu became involved after being convinced to teach for Splash (probably by Michael Shaw) and Mike doesn't remember how he became involved, but Random Hall/related people are distinct suspects.  Yalu remembers talking to Mike a few times at the Splash Help Desk, and Mike remembers wondering who Yalu was at Lobby 13 Morning Registration, since she didn't show up for any of the weekly meetings except for the one before Splash.  After Splash, they did not see much of each other aside from a couple of end-of-term ESP meetings.

<p>In January, during MIT's Independent Activies Period (IAP), Liza arranged an early morning group to help hang up posters down the Infinite Corridor.  Yalu arrived on the dot (at some brutal hour, like 8am) in Lobby 7, to find Mike sitting on top of a pedestal (like <a href="http://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by_year/2012/circus7/topsyturvy1.jpg">this</a> one, minus the clown and chairs &ndash; there are 4 in Lobby 7, at the corners).  "Good morning," she said sleepily.  "Good evening!" Mike said, and proceeded to explain how he was doing <a href="http://maslab.mit.edu/2012/site/maslab.php">MASLAB</a> during IAP and that had shifted his sleep schedule.  "There are 3 people on our team, 2 software guys and I am the hardware guy, so they work on the robot during the day and I work on it during the night".  Yalu then decided that she also wanted to climb on top of the pedestal (must be a cool view).  Unfortunately, there must be some required combination of height and upper body strength, because Yalu was not able to make much progress.  Mike lent her a hand, but she was unable to push herself up with the other arm.  So he grabbed the other hand as well, and tried to pull.  Yalu thought "this is definitely not going to work" and while she was dangling over the side of the pedestal, they looked into each other's eyes and fell in love.  When Liza (who was running 5 minutes late, getting the posters) arrived, Yalu was still trying to figure out how to climb onto the pedestal.

In early February, they started dating after seeing a screening of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278443/">Fermat's Last Tango</a>, organized by &ndash; who else &ndash; Michael Shaw.
