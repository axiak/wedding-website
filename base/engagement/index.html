Yalu and Mike's 6th year anniversary fell on a Thursday in 2012.  Yalu was at work.  Around noon, a popup appeared in her internet browser saying "please check out Google."  She thought, "wow, Google is getting really personalized now" and promptly went back to looking at her excel spreadsheets.  Five minutes later, the popup message changed to "Psst.. check out Google's Doodle."  She thought, "Google usually has really unique Doodles on their homepage, so let me take a look."  She wasn't prepared, however, to find her own face in the "G" of Google's doodle!!

She clicked on this doodle to see what it was about and it took her to a personalized site with a 7 hour countdown!  Yalu knew something was up, but had 7 hours to wait, and was anxious to know if her face was *really* on the page of Google's homepage (her co-workers hadn't said anything yet!).  So she logged out of gmail, checked the Google page again - face still there.  She thought it might be cached, so she closed Chrome, opened Firefox and checked the Google homepage - face still there.  She closed that, opened Internet Explorer - her face was still there!  Finally, she checked her phone and saw a normal Google logo (and calmed down).  Whew.

Mike and Yalu had agreed to meet after work, at 6:45 to celebrate their anniversary.  So Yalu made sure to leave work early (at 6!) and promptly called Mike at 6:45, thinking he would meet her downstairs.  She was told to finish the countdown, which she did at the second-nearest Starbucks on Boylston street.  Mike moved the countdown foward by 10 minutes to accomodate, and when the countdown finished, Yalu was greeted by a quiz on their relationship.  It was difficult.. and it was timed!  Ack!  Each question revealed a clue - Yalu peeked at the clues while still answering the questions, saw a string of numbers "4", "-7" and thought "Oh no, I am going to have to do a math problem, aren't I?"  However, when all the clues were revealed, she immediately recognized it as a coordinate (latitude-longitude), since she had been working with those at work.  She popped it into Google Maps, which revealed the location of a playground on the Esplanade, where Mike and Yalu had gone on their informal first date (off-campus!).

<p>
Yalu walked past work and past the closest Starbucks on Newbury, and found Mike waiting at the park - it was the same setting as last time: winter, nighttime - and he proposed there.
</p>

<h3>Proposal Tidbits</h3>

<ul>
<li>Mike rode the bus over from Cambridge, which was behind schedule and delayed even more so by a smoker who wanted to take her time at the Central Square stop - so it worked out well that Yalu insisted on going to the Starbucks on Boylston after all!
<li>Mike and Yalu celebrated the engagement with the tasting menu at Craigie on Main.  It was a fantastic 11-course dinner.
</ul>

<h3>Ring Drama</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Yalu never searched for the ring, but Mike was cautious and hid the ring in an (empty) can of black beans in the pantry.  Since he owns a can opener that cuts around the side of the can (instead of the top), the cans are reseable, so this can looked exactly like a can of beans.  Mike even used the kitchen scale to weigh the can, taping quarters inside to obtain the exact weight.
  <li>Yalu was suspicious of the ring - Mike ordered it online, and on the morning it arrived via Fedex, he woke up half an hour earlier than usual.  Yalu heard the buzzer ring, and when she returned to the door on her way out, she saw Mike had dashed out.  He came back in carrying a box, so she asked him - what's in that box?  He said he ordered a mouse online.  Later that night, Mike showed her his new mouse.
    <ul>
      <li>Fast forward a couple of weeks, and it is super bowl weekend, a week before the proposal.  Mike pulls out a bottle of Trader Joe's Ale from the pantry, and Yalu says - "Hey, where did you get that?"  Mike pretends that he went to the Trader Joe's near Yalu's work, which is on the way.  Yalu frowns - "They don't sell alcohol at that Trader Joe's."  Mike covers - "Yes they do, it's behind the soap section, next to the flowers..."  Yalu - "Hmm, there is not much space there, only a shelf."  In the end, it turns out that in order to obtain a mouse to cover for the ring delivery, Mike went to Microcenter, but couldn't resist also stopping at the main Trader Joe's.
